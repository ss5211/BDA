### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
(what you plan to do? why do that? how to do that? what differences will it makes?)
#### PCA

Principal Component Analysis is a famous method to reduce the dimensions of data into the most efficient dimensions. Later on, we will use the low dimensional representation of our data to apply classification methods. In order to apply this method, we need to obtain eigen-vectors and eigen-values of our data. This process might decrease the computational time of training the data by employing a lower representation of the data. 

#### LDA

Linear Discriminant Analysis is a dimensionality reduction method for supervised machine learning. This method might provide more accurate classificataion results as our current problem is supervised machine learning. This method will map the data into new dimensions where the same famility clusters will be as close as possible to each other, on the same time, it will highly distinguished between different family clusters. We are expecting to acquire more accurate results together with high computational speed in terms of training the data. 

#### Kernel Methods

We are going to use for example Radial basis function kernel or Polynomial kernel to transfer data-set into a higher dimensions.  Data may be linearly separable in the higher dimensions, and we could classify our data as accurate as possible.
